            There is no official date to when I started programming. But my first memories are in school with the turtle in windows at the age of 7-8. Then in university using cpp to learn about bisection search and solve other mathematical equations. It was extremely hard, I could not get it from the first time. I had to memorize bunch of things without having a full grasp of them.
